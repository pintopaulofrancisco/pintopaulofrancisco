# Hello, I'm Francisco ðŸ‘‹

Today, I am currectly working as a Support Escalation Engineer at Microsoft, Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹.
Apart from this, I also have a tremendous passion aobut coding.. this is the reason why I am always pushing myself to learn something new and improve my programming skills and knowledge every single day!


## ðŸ‘€ My motivation and curiosity

My real motivation as an it Professional is to help everyone in the world to achieve their goals..
Having the power to know how to code and develop a solution, even when a custom build is needed for any customer/colleague, as well the power of troubleshooting software issues is amazing ðŸ’ª

My curiosity always brought me to the next level in my learning path. It prompted me new opportunities and passions not just at work, but also on personal life basis. For example, I start meditating and eat less processed food as well expanding my network a year ago.. And now, I feel a lot more energy and motivated every single day, because I can assume that i know exactly how my body works and what is the real type of "fuel" it needs to be at 200% all the time, as well with the best people by my side supporting me (this is also super important) ðŸ˜‰


The technologies that i really enjoy the most to work with in programming are:
* JavaScript
* ReactJS
* NodeJS
* Typescript
* C# / ASP.NET
* C++
* SQL Server & Kusto Query Language (KQL)
