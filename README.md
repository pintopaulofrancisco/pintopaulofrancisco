# Hello, I'm Francisco ðŸ‘‹

Apart from this, I also have a high passion on coding.. that's is the reason why I am always willing to learn everyday something new and improve my programming skilld and knowledge!


## ðŸ‘€ My motivation and curiosity

My real motivation as a it Professional is to help everyone in the world to achieve their goals..
Having the power to know how to code and develop a solution, even if it's a custom build for any customer, I also have the power troubleshooting things ðŸ’ª

My curiosity always bring me to the next capture of my learning path, bringing me new oportunuties and passions not just at work, but also on personal life. For example, I start to meditate and eat less processed food a year ago.. And now, I feel a lot more energy and motivated every single day, because I can assume that i know exactly how my body works and what is the real type of "fuel" it needs to be at 200% all the time ðŸ˜‰

* JavaScript
* ReactJS
